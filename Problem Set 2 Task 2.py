# Task 2

# Yes ,it is possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20 packs if for some x, we can buy x, x+1,â€¦, x+5 sets of McNuggets.

# Thus, for the smallest possible number we can count in a problem, if we find a string of a sequence of numbers as long as the smallest number then any amount larger than the one in the sequence of numbers can  be calculated in exact quantity. 

# In the given problem, the smallest counting unit is 6, so for six consecutive values that pass the test of having an exact solution, any amount larger can also be bought in exact quantity.
